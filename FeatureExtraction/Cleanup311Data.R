#All 311 calls for open and vacant buildings reported to the City of Chicago since January 1, 2010.
#The information is updated daily with the previous day's calls added to the records. 
#The data set provides the date of the 311 service request and the unique Service Request No. attached to each request.
#For each request, the following information (as reported by the 311 caller) is available: 
#address location of building; whether building is vacant or occupied; whether the building is open or boarded; 
#entry point if building is open; whether non-residents are occupying or using the building, 
#if the building appears dangerous or hazardous and if the building is vacant due to a fire.

#All open reports of "Street Lights - All Out" (an outage of 3 or more lights) made to 311 and all requests completed since January 1, 2011.
#The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees approximately 250,000 street lights that illuminate arterial and residential streets in Chicago. 
#CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residentsâ€™ reports of street light outages.
#Whenever CDOT receives a report of an "All Out" the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights
#in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure that they are all working properly. 
#If a second request of lights out in the same circuit is made within four calendar days of the original request, 
#the newest request is automatically given the status of "Duplicate (Open)." 
#Since CDOT's electrician will be looking at all the lights in a circuit to verify that they are all working, 
#any "Duplicate (Open)" address will automatically be observed and repaired.
#Once the street lights are repaired, the status in CSR will read "Completed" for the original request 
#and "Duplicate (Closed)" for any duplicate requests. A service request also receives the status of "Completed" 
#when the reported lights are inspected but found to be in good repair and functioning; 
#when the service request is for a non-existent address; or when the lights are maintained by a contractor. Data is updated daily.
